This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to a dataset containing air pollution and weather-related variables to reduce dimensionality and identify key drivers of pollution. The analysis explores both scaled and unscaled PCA, comparing the results to highlight how variable scaling influences the principal components. Key skills include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, PCA interpretation, and visualization of results via biplots. The findings provide insights into how industrial activity, population, and weather conditions interact to shape pollution patterns.
