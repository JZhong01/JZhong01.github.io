In this project, I developed multiple regression models to predict median house values in California using socioeconomic and geographic data from the 1990 US Census. By applying transformations like Box-Cox and evaluating models with metrics such as AIC, BIC, and PRESS, I identified the Box-Cox Full Alternate model as the best fit. This analysis highlights skills in multiple regression, data transformation, and model evaluation, addressing challenges like multicollinearity and the interpretability of transformed coefficients. The project underscores my ability to balance predictive power with practical significance in statistical modeling.
