In this project, I applied K-means clustering to socioeconomic data from the 2017 American Community Survey (ACS) for all 50 U.S. states and D.C. The analysis explored how K-means could group states with similar socioeconomic characteristics both before and after applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The results demonstrated that PCA helped refine the clusters, creating more compact and distinct groupings. Key techniques used include K-means clustering, PCA, data scaling, and cluster visualization. The findings provide insights into patterns of state-level socioeconomic similarities based on key factors like population, income, and employment rates.
