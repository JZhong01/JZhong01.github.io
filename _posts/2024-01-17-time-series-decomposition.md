This project focuses on forecasting sunspot activity using time series analysis techniques on historical data from 1749 to the present. The analysis utilizes both Classical and STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) decomposition methods to separate trends, seasonality, and residuals. Forecast models were evaluated based on Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE), comparing results from different training set sizes. Key skills include time series decomposition, error analysis, model evaluation, and forecasting. The study discusses the impact of recent shifts in sunspot activity on model accuracy and the potential for future refinement using more advanced forecasting techniques.
