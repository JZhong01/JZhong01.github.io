In this project, I applied STL (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess) to analyze sunspot activity over the past 200 months, separating the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components. The analysis revealed key patterns, such as the 11-year solar cycle and recent sharp increases in activity. I also used a seasonal naive model as a baseline to forecast future sunspot numbers, evaluating its accuracy across different training set sizes. Techniques used include STL decomposition, time series visualization, seasonal naive forecasting, and error analysis (MAE, MSE, MAPE). While the baseline model had limited accuracy, this project provides a foundation for exploring more advanced forecasting methods like ARIMA and Holt-Winters.
