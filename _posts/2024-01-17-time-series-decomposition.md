This project focuses on forecasting sunspot activity using time series analysis methods. The dataset spans from January 1749 to the present, recording monthly mean sunspot numbers. Decomposition methods such as Classical Decomposition and STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) were employed to separate the trend, seasonality, and residual components.

Through error analysis using metrics like MAPE and MSE, the forecast results indicated that larger training sets provided better predictive performance, although limitations such as sudden shifts in trends affected model accuracy. This case study also discusses the potential for more complex models like exponential smoothing to capture these dynamics in future iterations.

Key skills include data preprocessing, time series decomposition, STL smoothing, and forecast error analysis.
